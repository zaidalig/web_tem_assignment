🎮 Interactive Web Games: Rock, Paper, Scissors & Guess the Number
Welcome to the Interactive Web Games project! This repository contains two classic games—Rock, Paper, Scissors and Guess the Number—integrated into a single web page. Both games are developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with jQuery, showcasing dynamic web development skills and responsive design.

🎉 Introduction
This project demonstrates the creation of two engaging web-based games:

Rock, Paper, Scissors: A timeless hand game where players choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors to compete against the computer. The game features real-time feedback, animations, and a responsive layout for an enhanced user experience.

Guess the Number: A number-guessing challenge where users attempt to guess a randomly generated number within a set range and limited attempts. It includes input validation, feedback mechanisms, and attempt tracking to provide a fun and interactive experience.

Both games are seamlessly integrated into a single HTML file, with separate CSS and JavaScript files to maintain modularity and prevent style or script conflicts.
